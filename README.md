# wavelengthwalfie
Brief Description: Wavelength With Alfie is a single-player wavelength-inspired game with Alfie (dog). The user types in a theme (e.g. brainrot), and then Alfie (openai's gpt-4o-mini) comes up with a Wavelength spectrum with two opposite concepts and a clue for the user to guess where on the spectrum the clue belongs to. Then, the user uses a slider to move the arm on the spectrum to make their guess. After the user submits their guess with the reveal button, it is revealed whether the use won or not based on how close their guess was to the clue's actual position on the spectrum.


Features: Flask backend, gpt-4o-mini integration, react frontend, etc.


Time Spent Developing Project: ~20 hours.
